# Meri
Meri is a dynamically typed programming language runs on Ruby.
Its name from Going Merry(ゴーイング・メリー) which is a ship in the One Piece(ワンピース) manga.

It's a functional programming language which I develop just for fun.
It's only a toy with less power.


## Usage
Build the target file.

```
$ bundle install
$ rake build
```
